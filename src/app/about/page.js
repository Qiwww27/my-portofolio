          Hi there! I'm a web developer who started my journey into tech through
          an intensive Full Stack Developer bootcamp at Hari Senin. This
          experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in both frontend
          and backend development. Throughout the bootcamp, Iâ€™ve worked with
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases
          such as MongoDB and MySQL. I've also learned how to collaborate
          effectively using Git and GitHub, and gained hands-on experience in
          writing clean, maintainable code. Beyond the technical skills, this
          bootcamp taught me the importance of problem-solving, teamwork, and
          time managementâ€”all of which are crucial in real-world software
          development. I believe that learning never stops, and being part of
          the Hari Senin community has been a meaningful step in my journey to
          becoming a well-rounded Full Stack Developer. Kalau kamu ingin versi
          yang lebih profesional, santai, atau menonjolkan proyek tertentu, aku
          bisa bantu ubah juga. Mau dicoba?
